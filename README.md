I am a web developer specialized in building full-stack applications with React and Node.js. Iâ€™ve also gained little experience with NestJS and am always eager to explore new technologies to enhance my work. I value clear communication and am committed to continuous learning and improvement. My goal is to use both my front-end and back-end skills to improve myself and the digital industry. Currently, I've started learning mobile application development to expand my skill set. I'm open to new opportunities and projects that allow me to grow as a developer.
